Objective is to learn about Monte carlo and model free prediction.
Monte carlo methods provide a way for solving reinforcement learning problems based on averaging sample retirns
For a well defined sample return we need to run monte carlo methods in a episodic setting.
Only in te end of an episode our value functions and policies change.

Understand On Policy Methods and Off policy Methods.
